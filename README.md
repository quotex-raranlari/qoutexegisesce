# What is OTC Market in Quotex?

## Introduction

Over-the-counter (OTC) markets are decentralized financial markets where
securities are traded directly between two parties, without the
involvement of a central exchange. In the OTC market, dealers quote
prices for buying and selling financial products, acting as market
makers.
